# Weather-Tek
The goal of this project was to design a weather station which can measure and display temperature, humidity levels, and wind speed to the client. It must be eco-friendly and safe to use. This would mean we have to find a power source that meets this requirement. It would also have to be made with minimal material and not produce any waste.

Our design includes 3 sensors, one to measure humidity, another for temperature and a third for wind speed. It has a lithium battery that can be charged with a PowerBoost Lipo charger. It also includes an integrated LED battery indicator. The shellâ€™s material is to be made of plastic. Our design can be improved by using more eco-friendly material. It could also have been made as  a larger design with a larger and more detailed display. Multiple more sensors could be added. The design could also be made to look more aesthetic and not as boxy. Having a green power source such as solar panels would help.

When 3D printing and modeling we have learned that while making a model, we have to take into account of print nozzles. This ended up making our prints 1mm smaller than intended resulting in most of our components not fitting. 

To avoid wiring  problems for future projects we need to take into an account of how much wiring we need to plug to all the sensors and arduino, and how much space we need for all sensors and wiring that can fit into the box.
